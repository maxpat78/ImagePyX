ImagePyX and SSWIMM
===================

PLEASE NOTE: this initial release with Python 3 support suffers from a painful slowness while calling compression C APIs (both NT RtlXXX and wimlib) - it seems Python 3 call mechanism is slower than Python 2: perhaps a Python module would help.

This is a Super Simple WIM Manager written entirely in Python[1].

Main compression support is provided by wimlib 1.3.2 (look at http://sourceforge.net/projects/wimlib)[2]:
optionally, the MSCompression library can be used (found at https://github.com/coderforlife/ms-compress), but
its LZX codec is quite unmature at this time.

With ImagePyX you can:
- capture a directory tree to a WIM Image, eventually compressing it and excluding files/folders
- update or delete an image inside a WIM
- append new images to a WIM
- apply (extract) an image from WIM unit to a directory, optionally excluding files/folders
- split a WIM into more SWM units
- export one or all images to an old/new WIM
- list and test image contents

On Windows, it can use the native RTL Xpress codec (8 only) and provides complete handling of:
 - short names
 - security permissions [4]
 - alternate data streams
 - hard links
 - directory junctions
 - symbolic links[3]

On Linux, it can handle hard and symbolic links; also, it's able to capture and restore UNIX permissions (UID, GID, MODE).

[1] Developed and tested on Windows with Python 2.7.3, 32-bit; tested with Linux Ubuntu 12.10, x32

[2] A simplified version with the codecs only can be built with GCC 4.7 on Windows: look at mingw_build.sh

[3] Administrator rights are required to restore (create) symbolic links

[4] Special privileges are needed to apply SACLs
